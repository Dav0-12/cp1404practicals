Reflection:
- regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve 
  during the course of the subject?
- regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

As I progressed through the practicals my duration estimates seemed to improve, although there were a few tasks
near the end of the practicals that were harder to gauge and required more time than expected.

From code reviews I learned multiple things. I learned that providing positive feedback is just important as critical
feedback. If a person did well on a certain section of code, informing them that the code looks good will increase
the likelihood they use good coding practices in the future. I also learned that critically analysing someone's
code can be difficult, to the point where providing useful feedback is just as hard as writing the code yourself.

I believe code reviews should be due before the practicals, as people often either did not review my code at all, 
or didn't review it until after submission, meaning the comments could not be addressed. 
Another potential solution to this problem would be submitting the code on Sunday with the link to the practical on
Github. The updated code could then be taken into consideration when marking.
I would also try and make the length and difficulty of the practicals more uniform, as some of the practicals had
components that were very easy, and others had tasks that were more like mini assignments.
