# CP1404 Practicals

## About me:

I am a second year engineering IT student who is developing their skills in python

## This Repository:

This repository contains practical work for IT@JCU CP1404. The intention of this subject is to learn python and
improve the readability of code by following good coding principles.

### Lessons learnt:

- Following the PEP-8 structure makes python code standardised and helps others read your code.
- 95% of your codes life it is being read, not written, therefore it should be well-structured.
- Code should be modularised into separate functions that aim to complete one purpose.
- Code should not be repeated if it doesn't have to be.
